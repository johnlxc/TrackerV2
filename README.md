This is Version 2 of the gas tracker application also featured.  This uses Laravel instead of CodeIgniter

The User logs in and records relevant data every time they fill the car with gas.  Then they can use the stats page to see how efficient the car really is and look for patterns

I'm rebuilding the app with Laravel because laravel is way better than CodeIgniter
